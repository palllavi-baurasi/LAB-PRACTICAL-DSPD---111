/* Write a program to implement a Binary Search algorithm. Write a search function which takes a Stacchist as its first parameter and a Comparable as its second. If either parameter is null or if the Searchlast is Last is empty, you should return NULL
 implement the following algorithm Examine the value in the middle of the current array and print it.
 If the midpoint value is the value that we are looking for return true
 If the value that we are looking for is greater than the midpoint value, adjust the current array to start at the midpoint and print the indes.
 if the value that we are looking for is less than the midpoint value, adjust the current array to end at the midpoint and prior the indes
 Continue until you find the value, or until the start reaches the end.
